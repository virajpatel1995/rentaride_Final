/**
 * This is the interface to the Persistence Layer subsystem of the Rent-A-Ride system.
 * <p>
 * Each entity class has three types of operations: restore, store, and delete.  The
 * store operation does an update, if the given argument has already been stored previously
 * (i.e., it is already persistent).
 * <p>
 * Note, that since the User class is an abstract class and no use cases in the Rent-A-Ride
 * system manipulate these objects, no methods for handling them have been provided.  
 * Nevertheless, such methods could be provided, if needed.  For example, we could 
 * easily restore all User objects (in fact, a set of all Administrator <b>and</b> Customers), and rely
 * on polymorphism to discover the actual type of each retrieved object.
 * 
 * Two association traversals return a Customer.  In this case,
 * all of the returned objects are going to be Customers (no actual User objects 
 * will ever exist).
 * 
 * <p>
 * For each binary association connecting two entity classes <code><i>ClassA</i></code> and <code><i>ClassB</i></code>, 
 * there are four operations: 
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>store<i>ClassAClassB</i></code>, which is used to create a link between two instances of <code><i>ClassA</i></code> 
 *     and <code><i>ClassB</i></code>,</li>
 * <li><code>restore<i>ClassAClassB</i></code>, two overloaded versions are used to traverse the link from 
 *     <code><i>ClassA</i></code> to <code><i>ClassB</i></code> and from
 *     <code><i>ClassB</i></code> to <code><i>ClassA</i></code>, and</li>
 * <li><code>delete<i>ClassAClassB</i></code>, which is used to remove the link connecting two object instances.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, depending on the multiplicity of the association endpoint,
 * the return value is either <code><i>ClassA</i></code> (<code><i>ClassB</i></code>), if the multiplicity is one or optional,
 * or a <code>List&lt;<i>ClassA</i>&gt;</code> (<code>List&lt;<i>ClassB</i>&gt;</code>), if the multiplicity is many.
 * <p>Note, that for any association endpoint with a multiplicity of one or optional, the entity class on the opposite end of
 * the association has get/set methods get or set the (single) linked object instance.
 * <p>
 * Finally, note that in case there are two (or more) associations connecting the same two entity classes, the name of an
 * association-related operation may include the name of the association between the classes to distinguish them.  However,
 * we do not have such cases in the Rent-A-Ride system.
