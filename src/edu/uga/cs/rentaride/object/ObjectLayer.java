/**
 * This is the interface to the Object Layer subsystem of the Rent-A-Ride system. The interface provides operations
 * realizing the life-cycle of both <i>entity objects</i> and <i>links</i> interconnecting them.
 * <p>
 * For each entity <code><i>Class</i></code>, there are four operations: <code>create<i>Class</i></code>, 
 * <code>find<i>Class</i></code>, <code>store<i>Class</i></code>, and <code>delete<i>Class</i></code>.
 * <p>
 * The <code>create<i>Class</i></code> operations are factory method-type operations to create 
 * new entity instances. There are two versions of this operation: one with arguments, which gives 
 * the initial attribute values, and one without (argument-less). 
 * The one with arguments is used to create a new entity instance which has not been persisted yet.  
 * Such an instance must be stored in the persistent data store before the use case terminates.
 * The version with no arguments creates an uninitialized entity object and should be used as the
 * first step when restoring the persistent entity object from the persistent data store (suitable
 * setter methods should be used to set the attribute values, as retrieved from the persistent
 * data store. 
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, the <code>create<i>Class</i></code> operations for classes participating in associations with 
 * other classes, and where the multiplicity on the other end of the association is one, have parameters
 * to provide the linked objects on the other end of the association.  Note, that a class participating in
 * an association with a multiplicity of one with another class cannot exist without a link to one other
 * object on the other end.  Therefore, such a link must be established at the time an object is created.
 * <p>
 * The <code>find<i>Class</i></code> operations locate objects satisfying given search criteria.  Each such operation 
 * returns a List with the located object instances.  Each of these operations accepts a single <code>model<i>Class</i></code>
 * argument. If the argument provided on a call to one of these methods is null, it indicates that all objects
 * of a given class should be returned (the search criteria are empty, and so all objects vacuously satisfy the
 * search criteria).  On the other hand, a given <code>model<i>Class</i></code> argument may have all, or just some 
 * of the class attributes provided.  In this case, the <code>find<i>Class</i></code> operation should return
 * only the matching objects, i.e., the objects with the exact same values for all of the provided
 * attribute values in the model object.  More specifically: 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>if the <code>model<i>Class</i></code> argument is null, all objects of the given class are returned;</li>
 *   <li>if the persistent identifier attribute is provided, only one object is returned;</li>
 *   <li>if some (or even all) of the attributes are provided, only objects with the same attribute values are returned.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The <code>store<i>Class</i></code> operations store the argument object instance in the persistent data store.  If an object
 * being stored is already persistent (<code>isPersistent()</code> returns <code>true</code>), the object is updated.  
 * Otherwise, the object is stored in the persistent data store for the first time and its persistent object identifier is set.
 * <p>
 * The <code>delete<i>Class</i></code> operations remove the argument object instance.  While the argument (proxy) object may
 * still exist in the JVM that created the proxy, but the persistent object will be deleted and the subsequent
 * <code>find<i>Class</i></code> operation call with the same persistent identifier should return an empty List.
